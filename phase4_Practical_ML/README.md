# Phase 4: Practical ML Engineering & RAG Applications

## Goals
- Understand basics of large language models (LLMs) and embeddings
- Learn vector databases and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines
- Complete hands-on project deploying an ML-driven application

## Progress
- [ ] Study LLM fundamentals and vector similarity search
- [ ] Build RAG pipeline using available libraries/tools
- [ ] Develop project demonstrating RAG chatbot or app

## Notes
- Resources: OpenAI API, Pinecone vector DB, LangChain, FAISS
- Focus on integrating ML models with data retrieval for real-world usage
