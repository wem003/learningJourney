## My Learning Roadmap

### Phase 1: Strengthen Programming Foundations
- Obtain **PCAP â€“ Certified Associate in Python Programming** certification.
- Refresh core programming concepts and improve fluency in Python.
- Prepare for advanced cloud and ML topics by solidifying coding fundamentals.

### Phase 2: Cloud & Machine Learning Fundamentals
- Earn **AWS Machine Learning Engineer** certification.
- Gain hands-on experience with AWS ML services, model training, deployment, and inference.
- Build foundational knowledge for integrating ML into scalable cloud applications.

### Phase 3: AWS Architecture & Security (Optional)
- Pursue **AWS Solutions Architect** certification.
- Learn core AWS services, architecture best practices, and security fundamentals.
- Enhance cloud infrastructure design and operational knowledge.

### Phase 4: Practical Machine Learning Engineering
- Study Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications.
- Explore vector databases, embeddings, and build RAG pipelines.
- Complete a hands-on project applying these technologies.

### Phase 5: Containerization & Orchestration
- Develop proficiency with Docker and Kubernetes.
